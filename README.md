# Welcome to my dbt project!

In this project, I set up an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Apache Spark, Azure Databricks, and the Data Build Tool (DBT) with Azure as my cloud provider. The project illustrates the process of data ingestion to the lakehouse, data integration with Azure Data Factory (ADF), and data transformation with Databricks and DBT.

## Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test
